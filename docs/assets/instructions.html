After the death of his father, T'Challa returns home to the African nation of Wakanda to take his 
rightful place as king. When a powerful enemy suddenly reappears, T'Challa's mettle as king -- and 
as Black Panther -- gets tested when he's drawn into a conflict that puts the fate of Wakanda and 
the entire world at risk. Faced with treachery and danger, the young king must rally his allies and 
release the full power of Black Panther to defeat his foes and secure the safety of his people.
